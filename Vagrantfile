  ## Configuration To Disable automatic box update checking

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # NOTE: This will enable public access to the opened port

  ## Configuration for forwarded port without mapping
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 80
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 443, host: 443
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 8080
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 10001, host: 10001

  ## Configuration for a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine and only allow access
  # via 127.0.0.1 to disable public access
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 80, host_ip: "192.168.1.10"

  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 10001, host: 10001, host_ip: "192.168.1.10"

  ## Configuration for a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine using a specific IP.
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.1.10"

  ## Configuration for Mount Volume / Share an additional folder to the guest VM. 
  # The first argument is the path on the host to the actual folder. 
  # The second argument is the path on the guest to mount the folder. 
  # And the optional third argument is a set of non-required options.

  ## Configuration For VM Name
  config.vm.define "devdocker-01" do |lb|

    vb.memory = VM_TOTAL_MEMORY
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--groups", ("/" + VAGRANT_CLUSTER_NAME )]
